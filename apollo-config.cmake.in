#=============================================================================
#
# Apollo is an online machine learning utility designed to support
# performance portability of HPC codes.
#
#=== Usage ===================================================================
#
# This file allows Apollo to be automatically detected by other libraries
# using CMake.  To build with Apollo, you can do one of two things:
#
#   1. Set the apollo_DIR environment variable to the root of the Apollo
#      installation.  If you loaded apollo through a dotkit, this may already
#      be set, and apollo will be autodetected by CMake.
#
#   2. Configure your project with this option:
#      -Dapollo_DIR=<apollo install prefix>/share/
#
# If you have done either of these things, then CMake should automatically
# find and include this file when you call find_package(apollo) from your
# CMakeLists.txt file.
#
#=== Components ==============================================================
#
# To link against these, just do, for example:
#
#   find_package(apollo REQUIRED)
#   add_executable(foo foo.c)
#   target_link_libraries(foo apollo)
#
#
if (NOT apollo_CONFIG_LOADED)
  set(apollo_CONFIG_LOADED TRUE)

  # Install layout
  set(apollo_INSTALL_PREFIX @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@)
  set(apollo_INCLUDE_DIR    ${apollo_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include)
  set(apollo_LIB_DIR        ${apollo_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib)
  set(apollo_CMAKE_DIR      ${apollo_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/cmake/apollo)

  # Includes needed to use apollo
  set(apollo_INCLUDE_PATH ${apollo_INCLUDE_DIR})
  set(apollo_LIB_PATH     ${apollo_LIB_DIR})

  # Library targets imported from file
  include(${apollo_CMAKE_DIR}/apollo.cmake)
endif()
